Active Information Gathering
a. DNS Enumeration
Enumeration is the process of collecting information about user names, network resources, other 
machine names, shares and services running on the network. DNS identification is the procedure 
of finding all the DNS servers and their relating records for an organization.
usage:-
dnsenum [options] [domain name]


b. Port Scanning
In computer networking, a port is a virtual point where network connections start and end. It is 
common technique hackers or cyber-security experts used to discover open doors or weak points 
in a network.
Network mapper, popularly known as Nmap, is the most widely known port scanner. It finds 
TCP and UDP open ports with a great success, and it is an important piece of software in the 
penetration tester's toolkit. Kali Linux comes with Nmap preinstalled.
Scan in verbose mode (-v), enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and 
traceroute (-A), with version detection (-sV) against the target IP (192.168.1.1):
root@kali:~# nmap -v -A -sV 192.168.1.1

c. SMB Enumeration
SMB( Server Message Block protocol) is a client-server communication protocol that is used for 
sharing access to files, devices, serial ports, and other resources on a network. SMB enumeration 
is a multipart process in which we enumerate the host or target system for different information 
like Hostnames, List shares, null sessions, checking for vulnerabilities, etc.


d. NFS Enumeration
NFS listens on UDP/TCP ports 111 and 2049. Use common tools like nmap identify open NFS 
ports.
nmap -sS -pT:2049,111,U:2049,111 192.168.1.0/24 -oA nfs_scan
grep -i "open" nfs_scan.gnmap

Use common tools like nmap or rpcinfo to determine the versions of NFS currently supported. 
This may be important later. We want to force the use of version 3 or below so we can list and 
impersonate the UID of the file owners. If root squashing is enabled that may be a requirement 
for file access.
Enumerate support NFS versions with Nmap:
nmap -sV -p111,2049 192.168.1.171
Enumerate support NFS versions with rpcinfo:
apt-get install nfs-client
rpcinfo -p 192.168.1.171
